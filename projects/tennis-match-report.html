        <h1>Tennis Consulting - Match Reports</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="project-details">
        <p> As a member of the Bruin Sports Analytics Tennis Analytics team, I acted as a team lead to produce match
            reports for the UCLA D1 Men's Tennis team. As a team lead, a major repsonsibility was to ensure each member
            completed their task for the report. This was due to the inherent demand for a quick turnaround coming from
            the player's desire to review their previous match before their next match. This aspect of the role helped
            me gain valuable leadership experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each match report had three steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Data Cleaning</li>
            <li>2. Visual Creation</li>
            <li>3. Final Report </li>
        </ul>

        <p> The Data Cleaning process began by initially looking over the data in excel for any glaring issues. We then
            moved to Python and applied our proprietary transformation pipeline to fix any minor issues in the data and
            prepare it for visualizations. </p>
        <p> The Visual Creation process was done in D3.js. We created a variety of visualizations to help the players
            understand their performance. The visualizations included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Serve Placement</li>
            <li>2. Return Contacts</li>
            <li>3. Winners</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The final step was to create the report. The report included a summary of
            the match, the visualizations, and some key insights on the player's performance. An example can be seen
            below.</p>
