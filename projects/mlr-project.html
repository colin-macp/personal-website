        <h1>Modeling NBA Point Totals Using Multiple Linear Regression</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="project-details">
        <p> This project was the final project for my Stats 101A: Introduction to Data Analysis and
            Regression class at UCLA. For the project, I built a multiple linear regression model to predict NBA team
            point totals from the 2023-24 season using other statistical measures such as rebounds and turnovers.

            Feature selection and model diagnostics were important to create an robust and accurate model. I utilized
            techniques like boruta algorithm, stepwise regression, residual plot analysis, and VIF to ensure these
            standards were met. This project gave me an introductory experience into applying regression analysis on
            real-world sports data.
