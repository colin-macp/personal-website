        <h1>C02 Emissions Time Series Modeling</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="project-details">
        <p> This project was the final project for Econ 104: Data Science for Economists at UCLA. The
            project required us to fit a time series model and a panel data model. For the time series model, we chose
            to investigate whether C02 emissions and Energy usage could be used to forecast Global Temperature changes.
            For the panel data model, we explored the differences in using pooled, fixed effects, and random effects to
            model different country's life expectancies using predictors such as GDP, Years of Schooling, and
            Expenditure on health care. </p>
